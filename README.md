# Purpose

Originally it was made for a real haircut salon, but the deal never made, so i changed the logo, the pictures, and the social links, and think of it as a practice

# Used technics

- Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node.js


# TODO

The mongoose would like to be used for storing the main details of the salon, the details what could be changed often by the salon owner. The main idea was that the admin has to log in with 'postman'
and in forms he could change the details like contacts, prices of the services etc... With models and repositories the connection was made with mongoose, and the data could be stored in the collections,
but the login, and the forms are missing.
